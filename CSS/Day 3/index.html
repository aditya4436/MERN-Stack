    <p>Inline CSS has the highest priority.</p>
    <p>"id" has the second highest priority.</p>
    <p>"class" has the third highest priority.</p>
    <p>"tags" (h1, h2, div etc..) has the fourth highest priority.</p>
    <p>If the link tag appears before the internal CSS then the priority will be given to internal CSS because it appears after the link tag in which external CSS is linked. Reverse is also possible.</p>
