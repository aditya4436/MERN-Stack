<h2>Who is a Frontend Developer?</h2>
<p>A frontend developer is a software engineer who focuses on building the user-facing side of a website or web
    application. They use technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (along with frameworks such as React, Angular, or
    Vue) to design and implement interfaces that users can see and interact with directly. Their job is to ensure the
    website looks appealing, functions smoothly, and is responsive across different devices and screen sizes.</p>

<p>In addition to coding, frontend developers also consider user experience (UX) and accessibility. They collaborate
    with designers, backend developers, and product teams to turn designs into working interfaces. A skilled frontend
    developer creates web pages that are not only visually attractive but also optimized for performance, accessibility,
    and speed.</p>
